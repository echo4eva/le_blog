# welcome!

hey this is my first blog ever! i initially made this website to write about whatever i learned in [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) since they recommended it, but i’ll probably write about whatever else i’m learning, my projects, thoughts in tech, and maybe thoughts in general. this website is my 3rd website ever made and 1st project made with svelte. so far i love how svelte is with their routing, it just seems super intuitive and easy. [i followed this one guy’s tutorial](https://youtu.be/RhScu3uqGd0?si=ApvfnzqUpuKrzOBw) who seems very enthusiatic about svelte, love him to death, thats how i feel about learning deep learning. he really made learning svelte so easy and i feel like i can make my own application now. 

### design

the design of this website was inspired by my [full-stack internship](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ixu9gwniqd5SCqLkZ6DLznSsu6Qjoun_gh1KG-HIchE/edit#slide=id.p). this website named [Project Guternberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) had us go into their files. idk i just thought about it before going to sleep, now i made it a reality the next day lol.

### future

that’s pretty much it! i will probably be updating this website a little bit here and there when it comes to UI changes. for example, i might wanna change the description into tags, so people can know by scrolling through which blogs are “irl, ai, tech thoughts, project” etc. but I will definetly be updating it everytime to post a new blog about whatever. anyways i’m excited now i have this set up!
